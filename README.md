# Building Machine Sales Application

# Purpose
Omega Sales App will assist car dealers which represent in Canada, USA, and Internationally
to request a quote directly on their mobile phones. The App will further determine which product
series is best suitable for the dealer’s client by asking a series of questions. The purpose of the app is
to reduce the elapsed time between an outside sales rep to visiting a potential customer and
returning to their office or a computer and type an email requesting a quote on the potential
customer’s requirement.

# Platform
The Sales App will be written in native iOS8 and Android SDK to ensure the best user experience and
overcome any limitations in pre-built cross platforms as well as with HTML5. This will also ensure
that future enhancements can be developed seamlessly.

# Features - Authentication
To ensure that only authorized car sales rep users have access to our Sales App, an online authentication
portal is developed to support secured mobile users authentication. An access panel will be created which will allow authorized staff
to add, delete, and manage specific users. The possibility of adding rights management with access
limitations in the future would be preferred. The authentication portal is hosted in a separate
cloud based solution.

# Product Series
On the start screen, a sales rep have product series to select from. The product series are:
Vertical Mast, Arm, and 4DML series. Once selected, a series of logic questions will help determine
the correct product to quote.

# Options
After the user selects a product, they can select popular options including but not limited to Cab, AC,
Mast Heights (Vertical Mast & 4DML only), Lights, Mirrors, Side Shift and Fork Positioner (Vertical
Mast & 4DML only).

#Submission
Once a series and product is finalized, the user have a field for additional comments to include
any specific instructions for the sales team. The final call to action is submited the
quote which automatically is emailed to sales team. A confirmation email and
notification is automatically generated that their request for a quote has been received and
that they will be receiving a quote within 48 hours.
